        <p> Bogota is the captical city of Colombia, in south america.
        </br>Bogotá is a territorial entity of the first order, with the same administrative status as the departments of Colombia. 
        </br></br>Bogotá was founded as the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada on 6 August 1538 by Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada after a harsh expedition into the Andes conquering the Muisca, the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano.
            It was Simón Bolívar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown.
            The city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the Bogotá savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes.

        <h2 id="language-heading">Español</h2>
        <p> Español, better known as Spanish, is the indigenous language of the people of Spain.
        </br> Spain, as a country, has invaded and colonized a number of countries in the past centuries, </br>
            and as such, their language has had a wide spread in those countries. Even adopted as a langugae of instruction in each respective country. </br></br></br>
            I got very interested in the language after having heard a few Colombian men speaking it here in Mthatha, and I had no idea what langugage it was. </br>
            It was just amazing to hear. So interupted them and I asked what language that was and where were they from. They were very nice an open. </br>
             Tried their best to explain things to me in English. I liked the language, and the country, ever since.
